    "1. Apply normalization 1NF -> 2NF -> 3NF\n",
    "2. Perform SQL queries on the normalized database\n",

    "### Working with db files in Jupyter\n",
    "- Python provides an interface for SQLite through the *sqlite3* module\n",
    "- The **`%%sql`** magic builds upon it (and other tools) to enable the usage of SQL commands within a Jupyter Notebook as in common SQL clients.\n",
    "- Before proceeding, make sure that **`wine.db`** is in the same path as this notebook.\n",
    "  - If **`wine.db`** is not in the same path, an empty **`wine.db`** file will be created, resulting in errors in later steps of the TP.\n",
    "- The SQLite module in Python commits transactions automatically, this means that any change in the DB is immediately written to the file, e.g. creating/deleting tables.\n",
    "  -  For this reason, it is recommended to have a backup of **`wine.db`** as it is provided in the course's website.\n",
