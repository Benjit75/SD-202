# SD-202
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course SD-202 at Télécom Paris

Databases have been the central core of any information system for many years. Appeared in the 80's, relational systems have not stopped evolving. The objective of this course is to understand the basis of databases, their conception and their exploitation. It is centered on relational systems which represent today the most successful technology in this field. The techniques that are presented highlight important concepts, such as : 
- Data models
- Relational algebra and the SQL language
- Relational schema design
- Data integrity and consistency. etc.
